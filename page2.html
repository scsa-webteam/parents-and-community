				<h1>How will my child be assessed?</h1>

				<p>Assessment is used to determine student progress and achievement. Good assessment helps teachers know what teaching and learning strategies are working in their classes and where there are gaps in what students have learnt. Assessments give students, teachers and parents information about a student's progress in learning.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="hwmcba-types" class="wrapper page section2">
			<div>
				<h2>What types of assessment are there?</h2>

				<p>There are three main types of assessment and they relate to how the assessment is used.</p>

				<div id="assess-boxes">
					<div class="assess-box">
						<img src="images/Diagnostic icon.png">
						<h4>Diagnostic</h4>
						<div>
							<p>Diagnostic assessment is used to identify student strengths and weaknesses. It may be used before or during a learning cycle to pinpoint where to provide support.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="assess-box">
						<img src="images/Formative icon.png">
						<h4>Formative</h4>
						<div>
							<p>Formative assessment is used to monitor student progress. It happens during a teaching and learning cycle. It can be used to give a student feedback about how well they have performed or what they need to do to improve. It can also help a teacher judge how much students have learnt and whether all students are able to show their ability.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="assess-box">
						<img src="images/Summative icon.png">
						<h4>Summative</h4>
						<div>
							<p>Summative assessment is used to make a 'final' determination of student achievement. It usually comes at the end of teaching and learning cycle. The length of a teaching and  earning cycle may vary. Summative assessment should also enable students to show their ability.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>	
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="hwmcba-principles" class="wrapper page section3">
			<div>
				<h2>What are the guiding principles for assessment?</h2>

				<p>The Outline sets out principles for assessment. These set the scene for assessment and ensure it is useful and fair.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessment should be an integral part of teaching and learning</h4>

						<p>Assessment, teaching and learning should all come from the curriculum as it is set out in the syllabus. They need to be connected. Assessment should give feedback to teachers and students about the students' learning progress and inform a teacher's ongoing planning.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessment should be educative</h4>

						<p>Assessment should help students learn. Students should be a part of the assessment process. They should have opportunities to reflect on what they have learnt and to plan for how to improve.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessment should be fair</h4>

						<p>Assessment needs to take account of the needs of students. It needs to be valid. A valid assessment is one that assesses what it is supposed to assess. For example, recall of facts should not be assessed if the main purpose of the assessment is to collect information about problem-solving skills.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessments should be designed to meet their specific purposes</h4>

						<p>The purpose of the assessment should be clear. It should also be clear what students are expected to do.</p>

						<p>Formative assessment should be used to see what students have learnt. It should be used to show gaps in what students have learnt and to inform ongoing teaching. Summative assessment should be used for assessment of learning and come at an end-point.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessment should lead to informative reporting</h4>

						<p>Assessment should provide information about student achievement that can be used for reports. The reports should give feedback about a student's learning progress and what they need to do to improve. Reports are intended to be helpful for students, parents, teachers and schools.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Assessment should lead to school-wide evaluation processes</h4>

						<p>Assessment provides information that schools can use to plan and to meet student needs. Teachers reflect on student achievements from the present and the past to plan for improvements in future teaching, learning and assessment.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div id="achievement-standards">
					<h3>Achievement standards</h3>

					<p>Across Foundation to Year 10, achievement standards indicate the quality of learning students should typically demonstrate by a particular point in their schooling. Achievement standards comprise a written description and student work samples.</p>

					<p>An achievement standard describes the quality of learning (the extent of knowledge, the depth of understanding and the sophistication of skills) that would indicate the student is well placed to commence the learning required at the next level of achievement.</p>

					<p>The sequence of achievement standards across Foundation to Year 10 describes progress in the learning area. This sequence provides teachers with a framework of growth and development in the learning area.</p>

				<h2>What does assessment look like in a classroom?</h2>

				<p>Assessment is an ongoing process. It can be formal or informal. Teachers monitor students' learning progress in classroom activities as well as in projects, assignments and tests.</p>
