				<h1>What will my child learn?</h1>

			    <p>The Western Australian curriculum has been designed to meet the needs of students in Western Australia. </p>

			    <p>In Western Australia, there is one curriculum for Pre-primary to Year 10 and another for Years 11 and 12.</p>

			    <p>You will find the Pre-primary to Year 10 curriculum in the <em>Western Australian Curriculum and Assessment Outline</em>. There is information about assessment and reporting in the <em>Outline</em> too. The <em>Outline</em> is in the Kindergarten to year 10 section of our website.</p>

			    <p>The curriculum Year 11 and Year 12 has information about courses and programs for Year 11 and 12 students. You can find out what students need to do to achieve a Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) by visiting the Years 11 and 12 section of our website.</p>

				<h2>What about the Kindergarten curriculum?</h2>

			    <p>Kindergarten is not a compulsory year of schooling in Western Australia.</p>

			    <p>Planning for children in the Kindergarten year is supported by the Kindergarten Curriculum Guidelines.</p>

			    <p>The Guidelines are part of the Western Australian Curriculum and Assessment Outline.</p>

			    <p>The Guidelines draw on the Australian Government’s Early Years Learning Framework. They build on five learning development areas from the Framework.</p>

				<h2>How does the Pre-primary to Year 10 curriculum work?</h2>

			    <p>In the early years of primary school, there is a focus on language and numeracy skills. Learning is often cross-curricular. This means that different learning areas are integrated.</p>

			    <p>As students move into Years 7 to 10 they begin to specialise. While there may continue to be a cross-curricular focus, student learning is often subject based. The subjects come from the learning areas.</p>

			    <p>There are syllabuses for each year from Pre-primary to Year 12. </p>

			    <p>The <strong>syllabuses</strong> are grouped in the following learning areas.</p>

			    <div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>English</h4>

					<div>
						<p>In the <strong>English</strong> learning area, students develop their Standard Australian English skills. There are three parts or strands in the English learning area. These are Language, Literacy and Literature.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Health and Physical Education</h4>

					<div>
						<p>In the <strong>Health and Physical Education</strong> (HPE) learning area, students learn about being healthy, safe, and active. They develop skills to live a healthy life.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Humanities and Social Sciences</h4>

					<div>
						<p>The <strong>Humanities and Social Sciences</strong> (HASS) learning area students learn about the world they live in. They study people and places and learn about the past and the present. HASS includes Civics and Citizenship, Economics and Business, Geography and History*.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Languages</h4>

					<div>
						<p>In the <strong>Languages</strong> learning area, students learn languages other than English. While learning a new language, students build communication skills and learn about other cultures. Diagnostic assessment is used to identify student strengths and weaknesses. It may be used before or during a learning cycle to pinpoint where to provide support.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Mathematics</h4>

					<div>
						<p>In the <strong>Mathematics</strong> learning area, students build numeracy skills and their understandings of mathematical ideas and processes. Numeracy helps students with their daily lives.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Science</h4>

					<div>
						<p>In the <strong>Science</strong> learning area, students develop a scientific view of the world and develop their understanding of science ideas and uses. They use this view to explore the world around them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>Technologies</h4>

					<div>
						<p>There are two subjects in the <strong>Technologies</strong> learning area. The first is Design and Technologies. The second is Digital Technologies. In both subjects, students develop skills in creating solutions for now and the future.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="syllabuses">				
					<h4><span>+</span>The Arts</h4>

					<div>
						<p><strong>The Arts</strong> learning area is made up of Dance, Drama, Media Arts, Music, and Visual Arts. Subjects from The Arts build creativity and communication skills. Students learn how to express their ideas and solve problems.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>*In 2016, <strong>History</strong> will run as a stand-alone subject for the last time. Some schools will choose to move to the new HASS learning area for Pre-primary to Year 10 in 2016.</p>

				<h2>How does the Year 11 and 12 curriculum work?</h2>

				<p>The Year 11 and 12 curriculum is taught as courses. Students choose a range of courses to meet the requirements for a WACE.</p>

				<p>These courses build on the Pre-primary to Year 10 curriculum. The learning areas continue to be important.</p>

				<p>Students choose from a range of courses to meet the requirements for the WACE. The courses are divided into List A and List B. List A includes The Arts, languages and social sciences. List B includes mathematics, science and technology. English courses are found in List A. Health and Physical Education courses are found in List B. </p>

				<p>Choosing courses from both List A and List B ensures breadth in the WACE. It ensures students are exposed to a range of learning areas in Years 11 and 12. Breadth is a requirement for achieving the WACE.</p>

			    <h4>Courses and programs</h4>

			    <p>Students can choose their courses from a range of course and program types. </p>

			    <p>There are five course types. ATAR, General, VET industry specific and Foundation courses contribute to the WACE. There are also Preliminary courses. Preliminary courses do not contribute to the WACE.</p>

			    <p>Endorsed programs and VET qualifications can also be studied in Year 11 and Year 12 and can contribute to a WACE.</p>

			    <div class="courses">				
					<div class="acchead">ATAR courses<span>+</span></div>

					<div class="accbody">
						<p>ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) courses are offered at Year 11 and Year 12. There is a syllabus for each year. The Year 11 syllabus covers Units 1 and 2, and the Year 12 syllabus covers Units 3 and 4.</p>

			    		<p>ATAR courses are examined by the Authority. ATAR course examinations are conducted at the end of Year 12.</p>

			    		<p>ATAR courses are designed for students who are aiming to go to university.</p>

			    		<p>The Authority does not examine General courses. However, the Authority uses externally set tasks (ESTs) in Year 12to ensure marking is fair across the state. The ESTs are set by the Authority.</p>

			    		<p>General courses are designed for students who are typically aiming to enter further vocational training or to enter the workforce after they leave school.</p>

				<h2>Is there a curriculum for students with disability in K–10?</h2>

			    <p>Many students with disability will be able to access the <em>Western Australian K – 10 Curriculum</em>. </p>

			    <p>There are provisions for adjustments to be made for students whose access to timed assessments could be significantly affected due to a diagnosed disability, impairment or medical condition. These are detailed in Guidelines for disability adjustment for timed assessments. The Guidelines are available on our website.</p>

			    <p>Some students with disability may require more support. For these students, schools may choose to use the ABLE<em>WA</em> curriculum and the assessment tool.</p>

			    <p>Schools will determine whether the ABLE<em>WA</em> curriculum and the assessment tool are suitable for their students. </p>

			    <p>The ABLE<em>WA</em> curriculum covers English, mathematics, science and history. It is for students who have a disability and additional needs and who are unable to access the Pre-primary curriculum from the <em>Western Australian Curriculum and Assessment Outline</em>.</p>

			    <p>The ABLE<em>WA</em> curriculum maps to the <em>Western Australian K – 10 Curriculum</em> and provides specific content across four stages of difficulty prior to the Pre-primary curriculum content.</p>

				<h2>Is there a curriculum for students with disability in Years 11 and 12?</h2>

			    <p>Some students with special educational needs may require modifications/adjustments to their learning programs and assessments to access the curriculum equitably. If enrolled in ATAR, General or Foundation courses the achievement of these students should be reported against the achievement standard of the course. </p>

			    <p>The Authority provides a range of support for students with special educational needs. These are students who have been identified as having a disability recognised under the <em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</em> and who, as a consequence of their disability: </p>

			    <ul>
			    	<li>cannot access the ATAR, General or Foundation course content with adjustment and/or disability provisions, <strong>or</strong> </li>
			    	<li>require modified and/or independent education plans.</li>
			    </ul>

			    <p>Preliminary courses are restricted to students who have been identified as having a learning difficulty and/or an intellectual disability. They are designed to accommodate the broad range of abilities of students with special educational needs and to allow for adapted approaches to teaching and learning. Each Preliminary course comprises units that are described in each syllabus. Students are not required to attempt all four units. Teachers are best placed to decide how many and which units to include within the individual learning plan for each student. </p>

			    <p>Preliminary units in themselves do not contribute to the requirements for the WACE. However, students undertaking Preliminary units may also undertake workplace learning, VET and ASDAN modules, all of which do contribute to the WACE.</p>

			    <p>There are provisions for adjustments to be made for students whose access to timed assessments could be significantly affected due to a diagnosed disability, impairment or medical condition.
